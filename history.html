    <h1>History of Video Games</h1>
    <p>Video games are digital games that can be played on a computer device (e.g., tablets, smartphones, laptops, consoles, etc.).
Originally designed simply for entertainment, video games have grown into their own industry and field of learning,
generating billions of dollars each year.</p>
    <p>"All your base are belong to us"</p>
    <h2>The Beginning of the 1950's</h2>
    <p>British professor A.S Douglas created OXO, also known as noughts and crosses or Tic-Tac-Toe, as a part of his doctoraldissertation at the University of Cambridge.</p>
    <p>Another game that top the charts next to Tic-Tac-Toe, was Tennis for Two.</p>
    <p>One of the first non-computerized game to come out was from MIT. It was called "Bouncing Ball". It was amde in 1947 but had become popularized from 1950 to 1951.</p>
    <h2>Video Games at Home (1960-1983)</h2>
    <p>The first computer based video game for computers across the U.S was "Spacewar". It was created by a student, named Steve Russell at MIT.</p>
    <p>A man named Nolan Bushnell created one of the first arcade machines that we know and love today. It held the game table tennis, but broke down because so many people jammed it with quarters.</p>
    <p>Another famous game that was released in 1976 is Death Race. This arcade game gave you the experience of driving and crashing into other cars/ players.</p>
    <h2>North American Video Game Crash (1983)</h2>
    <p>Markets over hyped low quality, cheaply made games, such as E.T. The game was based on the movie and created by Atari. This game became known as the worst game tht had ever been created.</p>
    <p>This game was actually SO bad that they had to take it down from the market and never put it back up. With all the copies that had been made, they put all of them in the desert and buried them in the sand. They are still there to this day.</p>
    <p>In 1983, the famous Japanese company, known today as Nintendo, introduced an 8-bit gaming console. An 8-bit gaming console is basically a family computer, but is best known for its name "Famicom". Two years later, Nintendo released this console in North America. They released it as the NES System. (Nintendo Entertainment System)</p>

    <h2>Rise of Games in the East</h2>
    <p>The 8-bit gaming console from above was only in a small test-market run. But later on it would be one of the best gaming systems ever created at the time.</p>
    <p>A new gaming console joined the gamimg market from 1983-2001. It was called the SG-1000 created by SEGA. (The creator of the hit game Sonic the Hedgehog.)But sadly this console wasn't very successful due to strong competition companies.</p>
    <p>In Japan during the late 1980's, SEGA released the Sega Mega Drive. (Or later called the Sega Genisis)</p>
